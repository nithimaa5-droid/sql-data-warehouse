BUILDING A MODERN DATA WAREHOUSE WITH SQL SERVER INCLUDING ETL PROCESSES, DATA MODELING, AND ANALYTICS
Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from building a structured data warehouse to generating insightful reports. It highlights modern practices in data engineering, modeling, and business analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture follows the Medallion Architecture, consisting of Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:


Bronze Layer – Stores raw data exactly as received from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database.

Silver Layer – Cleans, standardizes, and transforms the data to make it consistent and reliable.

Gold Layer – Contains business-ready, analytics-focused data modeled into a star schema.

📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

Data Architecture – Designing and implementing the Medallion Architecture.

ETL Pipelines – Extracting, transforming, and loading data efficiently.

Data Modeling – Creating fact and dimension tables for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting – Writing SQL-based reports and generating insights.

🎯 Skills demonstrated in this project:

SQL Development

Data Architecture

Data Engineering

ETL Pipeline Design

Data Analytics

🛠️ Tools and Resources

The project is built entirely using freely available tools:

SQL Server Express
 – For database creation and storage.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
 – For managing and querying databases.

Draw.io
 – For visualizing data flows and architecture diagrams.

Notion
 – For project planning and documentation.

🚀 Project Requirements
Data Engineering: Building the Data Warehouse

Objective
Develop a modern SQL Server data warehouse to consolidate sales data and provide meaningful analytics.

Specifications

Data Sources: Import data from ERP and CRM systems (CSV format).

Data Quality: Perform cleaning and validation before integration.

Integration: Merge both datasets into a unified analytical model.

Scope: Focus on the latest dataset; historization not required.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation for future reference.

Data Analysis and Reporting

Objective
Generate actionable insights through SQL queries and reports focusing on:

Customer behavior

Product performance

Sales trends
